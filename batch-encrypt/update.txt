./aes.sh encrypt will now encrypt all .png files in the folder.

Fixed the script to correctly loop through and process all .png files.
Ensured it properly decrypts .png.enc files by removing the .enc extension.
Added || continue to skip non-existent files in loops.

Now processes images from the "images" folder.
Saves encrypted files in a newly created "enc" folder.
Decrypts files from "enc" back into "images".

The new encryptX command now performs both encryption and decryption in one sweep.
