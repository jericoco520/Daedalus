<h2># Ionic/Angular Photo Gallery App - Development Update  </h2>

** Date:** March 19, 2025

<h3>## Current Challenge</h3>  
I'm facing issues with **image display** in my mobile/web application. The main struggle comes from learning the syntax and structure of **Ionic** and **Angular**, as both are new to me. Adjusting to their framework and best practices has been challenging, but I'm actively working through it.  

<h3>##  Next Steps  </h3>
- Debug and refine image display functionality  
- Explore Ionic and Angular documentation for best practices  
- Experiment with different approaches to solve display issues  

Alex has offered to help collaborate with me as best as he can to get the web app up and running.
